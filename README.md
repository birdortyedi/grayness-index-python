## Installation

```
pip install grayness-index-python
```

## Basic Usage

```
import numpy as np
import math
from scipy.io import loadmat

from grayness_index import GraynessIndex

gi = GraynessIndex()
mat = loadmat("imgs/exampleimg.mat")
gt = mat["gt"]
input_im = mat["input_im"]  #Â np.ndarray with shape H x W x 3.
pred_illum = gi.apply(input_im)
error = np.arccos(pred_illum @ gt.transpose()) * 180 / math.pi
log.info(f"Error: {error}")
```
